# DinoGame
Simple platformer for Android with Bluetooth multiplayer capability. 

Dinogame is a traditional sidescroller platformer, where you play as a green dinosaur.
Levels 1 and 2 are finished and bluetooth works between two mobile devices. Only prerequisite is that the two 
bluetooth devices have been paired previously (see paired in the device's bluetooth settings).

To initiate a bluetooth connection, one device has to initiate as the server and the other has to pair to the correct device using the UI to select it.
After this, the bluetooth connection is established and both players will appear in the platformer level.
